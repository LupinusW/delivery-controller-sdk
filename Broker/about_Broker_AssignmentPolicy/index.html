<h2 id="short-description"><a class="toclink" href="#short-description">SHORT DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Controls the automatic, permanent assignment of machines to users.
</pre></div>


<h2 id="long-description"><a class="toclink" href="#long-description">LONG DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>The site&#39;s assignment policy defines rules controlling automatic assignment 
of machines to users in a process referred to as Assign On First Use (AOFU).

In this assignment model, a desktop group is initially populated with 
machines that have no assignments, and users are granted entitlements to 
obtain a machine selected at random from the pool by self-service 
assignment. Once made, the assignment is permanent. The resulting assigned 
machines can be used to deliver either desktop or application sessions 
depending on the delivery type of the desktop group.

The assignment policy comprises a set of rules. The policy can be applied 
only to desktop groups of desktop kind Private.

For assignment of machines to deliver desktop sessions:

o   Multiple rules can apply to the same desktop group. 
o   Each rule grants an entitlement to one or more machines.

For assignment of machines to deliver application sessions:

o   Only a single rule can apply to a given desktop group. 
o   Each rule grants an entitlement to a single machine. 
o   Although only a single application assignment rule can be defined for a 
    group, a user can still launch multiple applications from that group 
    because the applications all run within the same session on the assigned 
    machine.

Once a machine is assigned to a user by an assignment policy rule, the rule 
plays no further part in controlling access to that machine. The rule can be 
changed, or even removed, without impacting the user&#39;s access to the 
machine.

Rules for desktop and application machine assignments are distinct. Desktop 
assignments are managed through the BrokerAssignmentPolicyRule SDK object, 
and application rules through the BrokerAppAssignmentPolicyRule object.

Desktop machine assignment rules can  be created only for desktop groups 
with delivery type DesktopsOnly, whereas an application machine assignment 
rule can be created only for delivery type AppsOnly.

Because desktop groups of assigned machines do not allow delivery type 
DesktopsAndApps, desktop machine assignment and application machine 
assignment rules cannot exist for the same desktop group.

Assignment policy rules are also used to configure the RemotePC feature 
where their detailed usage differs. For more information on the RemotePC 
feature see &quot;help about_Broker_RemotePC&quot;.

For an entitlement granted by the assignment policy to be available to a 
user, the site&#39;s access policy must also grant them access to the desktop 
group.
</pre></div>


<h2 id="assignment-policy-rules"><a class="toclink" href="#assignment-policy-rules">ASSIGNMENT POLICY RULES</a></h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Each assignment policy rule has the following key properties:

o   The desktop group to which it applies (one rule only ever applies to one 
    group). 
o   The users to which machines can be assigned by the rule.

Additionally for desktop assignment rules, the following properties exist:

o   The published name of the entitlement (visible to the user). 
o   The number of machines (entitlements) to which the rule grants access. 
o   The properties that a newly assigned desktop acquires.

If multiple desktop assignment rules entitle a user to machines from the 
same desktop group, their total machine entitlement is the sum of those 
granted by all those rules. The properties of the desktop sessions obtained 
may differ depending on which of the entitlements the user selects to start 
a session.

Each rule can be individually enabled or disabled. A disabled rule is 
ignored when the assignment policy is evaluated.
</pre></div>


<p>USER FILTERS (FULL) 
    Each rule has two user filters, an include filter and an exclude filter: </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>o   The include filter contains users and user groups that are granted 
    entitlements to machines. 
o   The exclude filter contains users and user groups that are denied 
    entitlements to machines.

If the include filter of a rule contains multiple instances of a user 
(either explicit or implicit), this does not alter the number of machine 
entitlements granted to them by the rule.

Entries in the exclude filter take priority, so if a user appears explicitly 
or implicitly in both filters, access is denied. Typically, you use this 
filter to exclude a user or group of users who would otherwise gain access 
because they are members of a user group specified in the include filter.

Because all rules are independently evaluated, the exclude filter can 
exclude only users who would otherwise gain an entitlement through the same 
rule&#39;s include filter. That is, if a user is in a rule&#39;s include filter but 
not its exclude filter, the rule is guaranteed to grant that user access to 
a machine irrespective of whether the user appears in the exclude filter of 
other rules.

If a filter contains a user group that contains other users and groups, the 
filter implicitly includes all of those users and groups.

By default the exclude filter is disabled.

To maintain assignment policy rules that can be fully displayed and edited 
with Citrix Studio, use the simplified user filter model below and do not 
use the exclude filter.
</pre></div>


<p>USER FILTERS (SIMPLIFIED) 
    The included user filter described above also supports a simplified usage 
    model where the filter itself is disabled. When this is done, any user who 
    has access to the desktop group through the access policy is implicitly 
    granted an entitlement to a machine through the entitlement policy rule 
    without the need to list the user in the rule's include filter. </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>This is useful in cases where the access policy for the desktop group 
already explicitly specifies the users who should have access.

Even if the include filter is disabled, the exclude filter can still be used 
to deny the entitlement to users who would otherwise gain access through the 
access policy alone.

This simplified usage cannot be used for RemotePC desktop groups.
</pre></div>


<p>REMOTE PC USAGE 
    When a desktop group is configured as a RemotePC group, the usage of the 
    assignment policy differs in the following ways: </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>o   Only a single rule can apply to a given desktop group. 
o   The delivery type of the desktop group must be DesktopsOnly. 
o   The simplified user filter model cannot be used. Users or user groups 
    must appear explicitly in the included user filter of the assignment 
    policy rule. 
o   If the included user filter is disabled then RemotePC assignment for 
    the group is also effectively disabled.

For more information on the RemotePC feature see 
&quot;help about_Broker_RemotePC&quot;.
</pre></div>


<h2 id="additional-desktop-assignment-rule-properties"><a class="toclink" href="#additional-desktop-assignment-rule-properties">ADDITIONAL DESKTOP ASSIGNMENT RULE PROPERTIES</a></h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Desktop assignment rules specify the following additional properties:

o   PublishedName 
o   Description 
o   IconUid 
o   ColorDepth 
o   SecureIcaRequired

The published name, description, and icon UID properties apply to the 
desktop entitlement itself and determine the way in which the entitlement is 
presented to the user in, for example, StoreFront.

The color depth and secure ICA properties apply to the desktop session that 
is obtained when the entitlement is used.

In all cases, these properties can be explicitly specified. However, a null 
value (the default) means that the corresponding property is taken from the 
desktop group to which the rule applies. This inheritance from groups is 
dynamic; if the property of the group changes, the property of the 
entitlement changes too.

For assignment rules these properties are copied to the newly assigned 
desktop when the granted entitlement is first used. If the properties on the 
rule are subsequently changed the properties on the user&#39;s assigned desktop 
do not change. The dynamic inheritance of desktop properties from the 
desktop group continues after the assignment has occurred if the original 
rule did not provide explicit property values.
</pre></div>


<h2 id="calculating-overall-machine-entitlements"><a class="toclink" href="#calculating-overall-machine-entitlements">CALCULATING OVERALL MACHINE ENTITLEMENTS</a></h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Assignment rules are modified only by the SDK; they are not modified when 
used by the system to make automatic assignments. The number of machine 
entitlements offered to the user is determined by the number of machines 
(within the desktop group) already assigned to them and by which rules those 
assignments were made.

For each desktop group, the number of desktop entitlements available to the 
user is determined as follows:

1.  The total number of entitlements for the user to machines in the group, 
    from all rules, is calculated. 
2.  The total number of assigned machines (from any source) that the user 
    already has in the group is determined. 
3.  The outstanding entitlement value is derived as the difference of the 
    above two numbers. 
4.  If the outstanding entitlement value is zero or fewer, no further 
    entitlements are allowed. 
    Otherwise, for each applicable rule, the number of entitlements is 
    that defined by the rule itself, minus the number of desktops already 
    assigned to the user by that rule, and capped by the outstanding 
    entitlement value.

Desktop and application machine entitlements both follow the above rules. 
However, because only a single application assignment rule granting a single 
entitlement per group can exist, these rules are seldom a consideration 
for applications.
</pre></div>


<p>EXAMPLES 
    Simple case: 
        A user is entitled to a single machine in a group by a single 
        assignment rule: </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>    1.  On first use, the user sees a single desktop entitlement. 
        If the user selects this, a new desktop is assigned. 
    2.  On subsequent uses, the user sees the assigned desktop only. 
        No other entitlements are displayed.

Complex case: 
    A user is entitled to two machines, one from each of two different 
    rules, A and B, both applying to the same desktop group. In addition, 
    the user has a machine explicitly assigned to them by the 
    administrator within that group:

    1.  On first use, the user sees the administrator-assigned desktop, a 
        single entitlement to a desktop of type A, and a single 
        entitlement to a desktop of type B. If either of the entitlements 
        is selected, a desktop of the appropriate type, A or B, is assigned. 
    2.  On subsequent uses, the user sees the administrator-assigned 
        desktop and the desktop assigned by the selected entitlement. 
        No further entitlements are displayed.
</pre></div>


<p>MACHINE ENTITLEMENT PRESENTATION 
    For desktop machine assignment rules, the user interface determines whether 
    users can visually distinguish between an entitlement to a machine and an 
    actual assigned desktop. This cannot be controlled by Broker SDK cmdlets. </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Although the number of entitlements seen by users takes account of all of 
their currently assigned desktops, the dynamic state of the system can 
affect the user interaction. This means that entitlements are displayed 
even where the pool of machines is empty, or the remaining desktops are in 
maintenance mode or otherwise unavailable. If the user attempts to use an 
entitlement in these cases, they receive a no-available-desktop error.

For application machine entitlement rules, the entitlements themselves are 
not presented to the end user; only the applications available to the user 
are presented. The use of available assignments, or of already assigned 
machines, is managed automatically.
</pre></div>


<h2 id="notes"><a class="toclink" href="#notes">NOTES</a></h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>If an assignment rule grants entitlements to a user group:

o   The machine is assigned to the user who selects the entitlement, thus an 
    assignment policy rule cannot be used to assign a machine to a user 
    group. However, an administrator can assign a machine to a user group 
    using the Add-BrokerUser cmdlet. 
o   The number of machine entitlements specified in a desktop assignment 
    rule applies to each member of the user group. For example, if a rule 
    grants a user group access to two machines, every user in the group is 
    entitled to two desktops.

The total number of machine entitlements defined by the assignment policy 
for a given desktop group may exceed the number of machines present in the 
group. A user attempting to use an entitlement when the pool of machines is 
empty receives a no-desktop-available error. (See CALCULATING OVERALL 
MACHINE ENTITLEMENTS above).

A machine assigned to a user as a result of the assignment policy remains 
permanently assigned unless the machine assignment itself is removed by the 
administrator. Such assignments are permanent even if the assignment rule is 
deleted, when the machine is treated as administrator-assigned.

The assignment policy cannot be used to assign a machine to more than one 
user. This is only possible using the Add-BrokerUser cmdlet.
